# Supplementary material for the *Plasmodium Falciparum* Transcriptome Manuscript

This repository contains much of the code and data used to produce the analysis for the paper *The Plasmodium falciparum transcriptome in severe malaria reveals altered expression of genes involved in important processes including surface antigen encoding var genes*.

It is organised into four main sections; the all gene differential analysis, the VAR gene transcript analysis, the VAR gene domain analysis and finally the VAR gene homology block and segment analysis. The data required to run these scripts is included in the repository however where read counts have been obtained from alignments only the count data is included. The raw reads are available from ENA with accesion number E-MTAB-5860 and PRJEB20632.


R version 3.2 was used when building the html files.

Questions about the code should be directed to:
